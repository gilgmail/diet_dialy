# Diet Daily Project Memory - Session Records

## 🎯 Project Overview
**Name**: Diet Daily
**Type**: Web-first PWA with medical health tracking
**Target**: 4-level health tracking system (差😞/普通😐/好😊/完美😍)
**Medical Focus**: IBD, 化療期間, 過敏源管理, IBS tracking
**Key Innovation**: 醫療討論功能 for doctor consultation reports
**Platform**: Next.js PWA with TypeScript
**Timeline**: 8 weeks (revised from 10 weeks with AI acceleration)

## 🤖 Current Development Strategy - AI-Assisted Database
**Database Strategy**: AI-generated 200-item Taiwan/Hong Kong food database
**AI Tools**:
- LLM-based data generation (GPT-4/Claude)
- Web scraping + AI classification
- Computer Vision for food recognition training
- Medical risk assessment automation

**Cost Efficiency**:
- AI services cost: $35
- Time savings: 78 hours (≈2 weeks)
- Net savings: $2,035 vs manual approach

## 📅 Current Milestones (8-Week Revised Timeline)

### Week 1-2: AI Database Creation Phase ✅
- LLM generates 200 structured food entries
- Web scraping for nutritional validation
- Computer vision training data creation
- Medical risk level classification

### Week 3-4: Core Development Phase
- Next.js PWA setup with TypeScript
- Database integration (AI-generated data)
- Basic UI components (photo capture, food logging)
- 4-level health rating system implementation

### Week 5-6: Health Tracking & Medical Features
- IBD/IBS specific scoring algorithms
- 化療期間 food recommendations
- Allergy management system
- **醫療討論功能**: Health data summary for doctor visits
- Symptom pattern analysis reports
- Food-symptom correlation charts
- Printable medical reports
- **Light Motivation System**: Recording consistency rewards, educational milestones (+2-3 days development)

### Week 7-8: Testing & Deployment
- Cross-browser testing (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- PWA features (offline support, push notifications)
- Google Sheets/Drive integration
- User testing with 10 beta testers

## 🏥 Key Feature: 醫療討論功能 (Medical Consultation Support)
**Purpose**: Generate reports to facilitate doctor-patient discussions

**Features**:
- Health data summary for doctor visits
- Symptom pattern analysis reports
- Food-symptom correlation charts
- Printable/shareable medical reports
- Timeline view of health trends
- AI-assisted medical report generation

**Report Types**:
- 健康趨勢報告 (Health Trends)
- 症狀模式分析 (Symptom Patterns)
- 食物關聯圖 (Food Correlations)
- 醫生友善的印刷版報告 (Doctor-friendly printable reports)

## 📊 Technical Architecture
**Frontend**: Next.js PWA with TypeScript
**Database**: AI-generated 200-item structured food database (JSON)
**AI Integration**: Microsoft Computer Vision API
**Storage**: Google Sheets/Drive integration
**Medical Features**: Risk classification, correlation analysis
**Platform Focus**: Web-first with PWA features

## 🎯 Success Metrics
**Database Quality**:
- >95% nutritional data validation
- 100% IBD/化療/過敏 coverage
- 100% Taiwan/Hong Kong food representation
- >85% food photo identification accuracy

**Development Efficiency**:
- 8 weeks vs original 10 weeks (20% faster)
- $35 total vs $2,070 manual approach (98% savings)
- AI ensures uniform classification standards

## 🎮 Gamification Strategy Decision
**RECOMMENDATION**: Light Motivation System (NOT Full Gamification)

**Core Reasoning**:
- Target users (IBD/chemotherapy/allergy patients) require medical credibility over entertainment
- Medical apps need professional trust, not game-like elements that could trivialize health conditions
- Users already motivated by actual health improvements - don't need artificial rewards

**Approved Elements**:
- Recording consistency rewards (streak tracking, completion badges)
- Educational milestones (learning achievements about nutrition/health)
- Health improvement visualization (progress charts, symptom trends)
- Personal achievement tracking (non-competitive)

**Rejected Elements**:
- Health score competition between users
- Food challenges or gamified eating
- Social leaderboards comparing health metrics
- Points/rewards for specific food choices
- Achievement sharing that reveals medical conditions

**Development Impact**: +2-3 days in Week 5-6 for motivation system (minimal cost increase)
**Core Principle**: Let actual health improvement evidence be the primary motivation source

## 🚀 Current Status (Session: 2025-01-14)
- ✅ AI strategy finalized and documented
- ✅ 8-week revised milestones created
- ✅ Medical consultation features designed
- ✅ Cost analysis completed ($35 AI cost, $2,035 savings)
- ✅ Gamification strategy decided (Light Motivation System)
- 🔄 Ready for Phase 0 implementation (AI database creation)

## 🎯 Next Session Priority
**Week 1 Immediate Actions**:
1. LLM Prompt Engineering for food generation
2. Data Structure Setup (TypeScript interfaces)
3. AI Pipeline Testing for classification accuracy
4. Medical Review Preparation

## 🔧 Fixed Issues & Improvements

### 1. Medical Scoring Validation System
**Issue**: `medical-scoring-validation.ts` had empty test suite causing failures
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive validation framework

```typescript
// Fixed validation system
interface ValidationResult {
  suite: string;
  totalTests: number;
  passedTests: number;
  successRate: number;
  details: string[];
}

✅ IBD Scoring Validation (5 tests)
✅ Allergy Scoring Validation (4 tests)
✅ IBS Scoring Validation (4 tests)
✅ Chemotherapy Scoring Validation (3 tests)
✅ FODMAP Scoring Validation (3 tests)
✅ Multi-condition Scoring Validation (4 tests)
```

### 2. Chart Component Testing
**Issue**: Recharts components causing rendering failures in tests
**Solution**: Comprehensive mocking strategy

```typescript
// Robust chart mocking
jest.mock('recharts', () => ({
  BarChart: ({ children }: any) => <div data-testid="bar-chart">{children}</div>,
  LineChart: ({ children }: any) => <div data-testid="line-chart">{children}</div>,
  // ... comprehensive mock coverage
}));
```

### 3. Performance Testing
**Issue**: No validation for large dataset handling
**Solution**: Performance benchmarks and stress testing

```typescript
// Performance validation
it('handles large datasets efficiently', () => {
  const largeDataset = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, generateMockData);
  const startTime = performance.now();

  render(<Component data={largeDataset} />);

  const endTime = performance.now();
  expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(2000); // 2s limit
});
```

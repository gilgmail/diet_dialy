## Test Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Open Food Diary Page**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/food-diary
   ```

2. **Test Custom Food Creation**
   - Search for a non-existent food name (e.g., "我的特製料理")
   - Click "快速新增自訂食物" button
   - Fill in required fields:
     - 食物名稱: "我的特製料理"
     - 分類: "其他"
   - Optional fields can be left blank or filled
   - Click "建立食物"
   - Verify success state appears
   - Confirm food is automatically selected

3. **Test Medical Info Alert**
   - After creating custom food, verify MedicalInfoAlert appears
   - Should show "等待專業審核" status with yellow warning
   - Should display educational information about medical scoring
   - Should include reminder that food can still be logged

4. **Test Food Entry Creation**
   - With custom food selected, proceed to add diary entry
   - Set serving size and meal time
   - Save the entry
   - Verify entry appears in food log with medical alert

### Expected Behavior

#### For New Custom Foods:
- ✅ Quick creation modal appears when no search results
- ✅ Minimal required information (name + category)
- ✅ Automatic pending verification status
- ✅ Success feedback with automatic selection
- ✅ Medical info alert with appropriate messaging

#### For Foods with Medical Info:
- ✅ Green "醫療資訊已完整" alert with score summary
- ✅ Color-coded medical scores (IBD, chemotherapy, FODMAP)
- ✅ Clear status indicators

#### Integration Points:
- ✅ Seamless food search → no results → quick add workflow
- ✅ Custom food creation → automatic selection → diary entry
- ✅ Medical alert display → educational messaging → continued usage

## Database Schema Verification

### Foods Table Fields Used:
```sql
- name (required)
- category (required)
- brand (optional)
- calories (optional)
- is_custom (true for user-created foods)
- created_by (user ID)
- verification_status ('pending' initially)
- verification_notes (explanatory text)
- medical_scores (null initially, populated later)
```

### Workflow States:
1. **Initial**: `verification_status = 'pending'`, `medical_scores = null`
2. **Under Review**: `verification_status = 'approved'`, `medical_scores = null`
3. **Complete**: `verification_status = 'approved'`, `medical_scores = {...}`
4. **Needs Info**: `verification_status = 'rejected'`, `medical_scores = null`

## Success Criteria ✅

- [x] Users can quickly add custom foods without medical info
- [x] Medical information is deferred to later professional review
- [x] Clear status communication throughout workflow
- [x] Seamless integration with existing food diary
- [x] Educational messaging about medical evaluation process
- [x] No blocking of food usage while awaiting medical review

## Next Steps for Admin Review

1. **Admin Food Verification Page** already exists at `/admin/food-verification`
2. **Medical Professional Workflow**: Admins can review and add medical scores
3. **Status Updates**: Verification status changes automatically update alerts
4. **Score Display**: Once medical scores added, alerts show complete information

The implementation successfully addresses the requirement: "食物日記 可直接新增自訂食物，之後再訂醫療資訊" (Food diary can directly add custom foods, with medical information added later).
